            <p>For context, Amazon 4-star is a new physical store by Amazon, focused on selling popular products from Amazon.com with an average review of 4 stars or higher. I was intrigued by the concept, specifically in what kind of products there offered because surely there are a ton of 4 star reviewed products. It turns out to be a ton of electronics, ranging from laptops, tablets, and smart home devices. There was also a section on popular miscellaneous items that Amazon sells (mostly under the Amazon Basics brand).</p>

<p>I wanted to buy a Chromebook as a cheaper alternative to the MacBooks I've been using for development. Recently, ChromeOS started supporting Linux, which makes it a lot more useable for me. I figured it was time to pick up a Chromebook to see if it can become a personal travel laptop that I can use for development.</p>
<p>I went in with the intention of buying a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_pixelbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixelbook</a>, which despite being a slightly older model now, has the best keyboard/screen combo + processor at it's price point. The issue is that the store didn't have it in stock, potentially due to the fact that at the time of this writing, it has a 3.9 star rating on Amazon. There were some rugged Acer and Lenovo Chromebooks, priced cheaply but unable to compare to the laptops running Windows that sported better graphics cards at a similar price. The salesperson recommended the Acer Spin 13 for a higher-end model, which had a decent Intel 8th I-5 processor but priced at $820 with thick bezels. When I found the same model on Amazon.com from a third party seller for over $100 cheaper, the sales rep said they couldn't match that price. They do offer the standard 30 day return policy with no restocking fee which is nice. The other chromebooks, priced between $200 and $400, were a lot cheaper, but had poor screen dimensions, a less than stellar trackpad, and poor processors (e.g. the Intel Celeron).</p>
<p>I'll likely pick up a Pixelbook to try out at Best Buy, despite the shorter return window (14 days) instead. Alternatively, I might wait to see the reviews on the rumored new Pixelbook coming out soon to buy that instead.</p>

            <p>I originally built my first desktop computer in the summer of 2017, just before the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/hongalex-static-files/crypto.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto-boom and GPU price spikes</a> that occurred towards the end of the year. I was pretty happy with the way it turned out, paying about $1100 USD for the following specs:</p>
<pre><code>1. Zotac GeForce GTX1070 AMP graphics card
2. 2x8GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3200 RAM
3. Ryzen 7 1700
4. WD Black 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD
5. Gigabyte GA-AB350M motherboard
6. EVGA SuperNOVA G3 550W Gold fully modular power supply
7. Corsair 350D Window MicroATX Case
</code></pre>
<p>The original purpose was to create a gaming desktop, so obviously I threw Windows 10 on it first. However, seeing it has a ton of computing power, I figured it would be great if I could use it for my development environment as well. Personally, I was never really a fan of Powershell since I was already too used to unix by the time I tried it out. I looked into using the Ubuntu subsystem for Windows for a bit, but never really got in the hang of it either due to weird permissions issues and interfacing between Windows files and subsystem files was confusing. Then, I tried simple installations of Ubuntu and Kali Linux as dual boots on a cheap hard drive that I had, but ended up bricking the installations due to misconfiguring the MBR or something, so I rarely used my PC for anything except Windows after that.</p>
<p>About a year later, I wanted to see if I could get MacOS running. I bought a cheap Crucial MX500 250GB SSD and went to town. Turns out, getting a Hackintosh on a Ryzen kernel is significantly more difficult, but there is a huge community in trying to get MacOS running on Ryzen, and I found a <a href="https://hackintosher.com/guides/amd-ryzen-hackintosh-guide-installing-macos-high-sierra-10-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear post</a> that got it working in the end. This worked out reasonably well for me, but realized that running MacOS on non-Apple metal creates a whole load of issues. I ran into issues including: Nvidia web drivers failing to keep up to date, no support for Facetime/iMessage, poor audio/bluetooth experience, and random failures when booting up. There was also a resolution issue that I eventually fixed with SwitchResX, but could never get the refresh rate to 144hz for my monitor that supports it. It was pretty cool at first, but I lost interest and didn't boot into my Mac environment for a long time.</p>
<p>This weekend, I remembered that I still had High Sierra on my Hackintosh and wanted to upgrade to Mojave for the fun of it. After looking through the number of issues that people were having, I instead decided to ditch my Hackintosh dreams (until it gets better) for a Debian Stretch installation up and running. <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian</a> is a open-source operating system based on Linux and uses an apt-based package manager. By default, Debian consists entirely only of free software. Google internally uses an in-house version of DebianTesting, so I wanted to try getting a similar experience on my home desktop.</p>
<h2>Bricking Debian</h2>
<p>I'm writing this post because within 24 hours of installing Debian, I've bricked my installation. Initially, it was because I was trying to get the latest Nvidia drivers (430.86), while only 390.116 was available through traditional <code>apt</code> non-free lists. This was required by <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lutris</a> as I tried to get games on Linux. Only issue was I failed to completely remove my existing 390.116 version of <code>nvidia-driver</code>, which led to a host of issues like <code>nvidia-installer --uninstall</code> wanting to remove the conflicting versions everytime I ran <code>apt install</code>. After that, I tried removing the default &quot;LibreOffice&quot; apps to free up space, but I think I also removed <code>lightdm</code> and maybe even <code>eth0</code> because I lost my nice GUI and also the ability to connect to the internet. Needless to say, my installation was done. The following instructions will hopefully servce as a guide to others (and future me) in case this happens again.</p>
<h2>Steps to setup Debian from fresh install</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create USB bootloader with min 8gb USB stick, <a href="https://rufus.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rufus</a>, and <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boot with your flashed USB stick and select &quot;Graphical Install&quot; with preferred settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Couple of options here. I personally enjoy <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=cinnamon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cinnamon</a> for my desktop environment</li>
<li>I used an entire 250GB SSD without a partition, but you could partition a larger disk beforehand if you don't have an entire disk to spare.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Debian GRUB menu, do the following to boot with CPU-based graphics. Otherwise you will get a black screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <code>e</code> to edit the boot command under the first option.</li>
<li>Find the line beginning with <code>linux</code> and after <code>quiet</code>, add <code>nomodeset</code></li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl+x</code> to boot with these settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Add your local user to sudoers with:</p>
<p><code>usermod -aG sudo username</code>
<code>su - username</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install some standard packages</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install vim curl git</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>contrib non-free</code> to each line in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. This will allow <code>apt</code> to find additional packages (like our nvidia-drivers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install powerline fonts</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install fonts-powerline</code></p>
</li>
<li>

            <p>It's been about a year since I initially starting interviewing for my current position at Google, as a Developer Programs Engineer (DPE) on Google Cloud. DPEs are engineers within Developer Relations (DevRel), with other roles including Developer Advocates and Technical Writers. Understanding what the current developer experience is, and how to make it better is at the heart of DevRel. While the concept is fairly abstract, that means there's a lot of flexibility in what DPEs can do. As a Cloud DPE, we spend a lot of time writing code which ends up in one of our <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repositories in Github</a>, often in the form of code samples or tutorials on how to get started with a specific GCP product. Beyond that, many of us choose to write blog posts, contribute to open source projects, engage with developers on StackOverflow and Reddit, or give talks at conferences. Having the flexibility to choose our day to day is one major reason why I appreciate my current role as a DPE. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/developer-programs-engineer-say-what-b12829729693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post by one of my colleagues</a>. For this post, I wanted to focus on what the interview experience was like for a new graduate.</p>
<p>Traditionally, DPEs and other positions in DevRel benefit from having prior industry experience, as it helps with the end goal of being able to empathize with developers. However, people within DevRel started to see the value in bringing on new grads, which introduces fresh opinions on how easy an API or service is to use and ultimately improves the developer experience. I was initially contacted by a recruiter by email asking if I would be interested in a DPE position. Like most college seniors studying CS, I had no idea what DevRel was, having only heard of traditional engineering positions like the coveted Software Engineer position at Google. Nonetheless, I dug a big deeper and was very intrigued by the (fairly limited) information that I found on the internet. During an initial phone screen after I expressed interest, the recruiter told me the interviewing process was fairly analogous to that of a SWE, and scheduled me for a technical phone interview.</p>
<p>The phone interview was scheduled for Thursday, about 8 days after I reached out with available dates, with a Cloud DPE from our San Francisco office. He started with a few basic CS related questions, such as what databases I've used before and some nuances in Javascript, based on the fact I have that listed on my resume. He provided me with a screenshot of a Stack Overflow question about someone asking why their async Javascript code wasn't working and asked me how I would answer it. Satisfied with my answer, we moved on to writing tests for cloud service, focusing on edge cases and how to robustly make sure everything was working. At the end, I asked him a few questions about the DPE role such as his day to day. He said it varied a lot from day to day, which at the time I found confusing but makes a lot more sense now that I look back on it.</p>
<p>I believe my phone interviewer was sufficiently satisfied with my answers to his technical questions because I was invited to schedule an onsite on Friday, a day after the phone interview. The recruiter I had been in contact with actually switched halfway through, but provided me with some standard resources on how to tackle the coding portion of the interview: CTCI, interviewcake, and a few Google videos for tackling coding interviews. I primarily prepared by reading through CTCI, and solving problems from Leetcode and CTCI on a whiteboard with a friend's help. I sent some dates I was available, and was scheduled for an onsite in Google's headquarters in Mountain View for almost 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>I was very excited for the onsite, since it was my first time seeing Googleplex and going to the bay area in general. The onsite process was nothing short of seamless, as Google handled booking the flight, hotel accomodations, and car rentals for the 2 days that I was in Mountain View. They also reimbursed for other expenses, such as going to and from the airport, and a $50 food stipend each day. I flew into San Jose International Airport (SJC) in the morning the day before my interview, and grabbed a car from National Car Rental, from which I have Emerald Club Executive status from my Chase Sapphire Reserve card. I grabbed ramen at Santouka in Mitsuwa and headed to Apple Park Visitor Center since the Computer History Museum is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. After that, I checked into my room at <a href="https://www.hotelvue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotel Vue</a>, and although it wasn't the nicest hotel in the area, it was free and very close to Googleplex. It also gave me the chance to explore the Castro St restaurants for dinner.</p>
<p>My interview began at 10:30 the following day in Building 41. After dropping my rental with the onsite valet, I walked pass the Android statue (Android Oreo at the time) and dozens of gBikes that littered the heart of Googleplex. I was scheduled for 4 interviews, 3 of which were in-person and 1 was through hangouts. Since each interview was about 50 minutes, the format of the interview was essentially 40 minutes of a standard algorithm/design question along with 10 minutes of other technical or behavioral questions. For the coding parts, 2 of my interviewers requested I use the whiteboard, while the other 2 requested I use Google Docs. Three of the technical portions were traditional algorithm problems (about leetcode medium difficulty), with the remaining being more of a systems design question. Each interviewer chose a different format with the time that wasn't allocated to the coding portion. One gave rapid-fire trivia questions, such as the difference between static/dynamic types in C++. Another asked me to choose a recent technology and asked how I would explain it to an average person (I chose to talk about bitcoin/blockchain). My last interviewer asked me if I was comfortable writing SQL queries, and asked me to write a fairly straightforward SQL join query. In addition to all that, there were standard behavioral questions (i.e. why do you want to join DevRel/Google) which I had anticipated based on tips from my recruiter.</p>
<p>After my first interview, there was about 45 minutes of lunch break scheduled with a manager that doesn't provide feedback and is meant to be a way to relax between interviews. We grabbed lunch at the noodle bar in Building 47 and had some idle chit chat where he asked me about my education history and I asked some questions on what it was like to work at Google. This was also the first time I got to see Google's microkitchens, which are essentially corners in different floors of each building that have a variety of snacks, bottled/canned drinks, and coffee. For the most part, I was too nervous about the actual interview that I didn't really explore the different snack options until I went back for my orientation session two months later.</p>
<p>It took about 17 days after I finished the onsite before I had a solid offer, which by Google standards was really fast. From what I understand, my interviewers gave me good feedback and I needed to move on to team matching before my packet could be presented to the hiring committee. Google does have a bad reputation of being slow to hire, with the justification that it keeps the bar higher. I started talking to hiring managers about 10 days after I finished the onsite, and got past HC 5 days after that. Then it took 2 more days to actually receive my initial offer letter.</p>
<p>Overall, I was fairly happy with interview process and was very excited to know I had landed a job at one of the best tech companies to work for in the U.S. I might write a separate blog post about the orientation process if I think there's enough information to talk about that's non-confidential, so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>I finally decided to switch to a new format for my personal website and here's why.</p>
<p>The previous iterations of my website were pretty crude. The first was written using very simple HTML/CSS, and before I understood good web development practices. I had used basically no JS aside from <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>particles.js</code></a> inspired from LA Hacks 2015's signup website which I thought looked very cool. This version was not mobile friendly at all and had only an &quot;About&quot; page with a HTML button that links to my resume. The second iteration was slightly better, but to be honest I don't really remember much about it. I think I still wasn't using a web framework, but at the very least, had tabs for more conent (links to Twitter, Github, my resume, etc). My third iteration was much better. I used <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a> to get more practice with it (I had more of an Angular background) and the whole thing was a lot better structured than my previous attempts. At this point, I had a good amount of experience in web development, so the website was mobile-friendly and took proper advantage of routes to prevent page reloads. However, after a while I realized that React still probably wasn't the best way to build a personal website. For one thing, adding pages was fairly tedious and unnecessarily so. I rarely updated my site because it took too long to change the appearance/layout.</p>
<p>I took a look at some other people's websites for inspiration and noticed a few trends. First, their website didn't have a link to an external blog site like Medium, but had in in their website itself. The pages were minimal, clean, and conveyed information very effectively. I believe some used services like Squarespace and Wix to manage their site, while others used Github Pages. I previously was using Github Pages with a custom domain and was fairly impressed by how seamless it was, but I wanted to see if there were other options out there. I came across an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article that described using Google Cloud Storage to host websites</a> and was fairly intrigued. Although not free, the costs were fairly low and I wanted to see if this was a better experience than Github Pages, so my blog will reside here for now.</p>
<p>For my static site generator, I decided on <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo.io</a> after debating between a few options. I knew I wanted to write my content in pure Markdown, and it claims to have &quot;Blazing Fast&quot; generation and ease of use. I also enjoy that it is Javascript-based, since I have a good amount of experience developing in JS. So far, I've been fairly pleased with Hexo, and I have since followed the instructions in the blog linked earlier to setup pushes to Cloud Storage via Google Cloud Build from Github triggers. This makes adding new content as simple as running <code>hexo generate</code> and then pushing to Github. The author of the linked tutorial also had a blog post on how to automate the process by building the website on a container first, which I will probably switch over to doing at a later time. For now, I'm doing a quick hack by adding the static page generation command to a Git pre-commit hook.</p>
<p>I'll try this format out for a while and see if I like it, or if I should switch back to Github Pages/Medium. Although I miss how easy it was to format articles on Medium, the lack of support for codeblock formatting really turned me off. With this, I can do nice stuff like this:</p>
<p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">"Until next time"</span> &gt; /dev/null</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
