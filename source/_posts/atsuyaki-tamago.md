One of my favorite pieces of sushi at Sushi Kashiba (or in general Edomae style omakase) is the tamago dessert at the end. This is a sweeter and denser version of tamago compared to traditional tamagoyaki/dashimaki tamago. It is similar in texture to a denser sponge cake.

I've seen two versions, originally with rice and later on just as a solid piece of atsuyaki tamago

I attempted [this recipe](https://www.tastingtable.com/cook/recipes/Tamago-Omelet-Recipe) from Tasting Table that references 15 East, a high end sushi place in NYC that I went to in April 2019. I don't remember the tamago, but I believe most Edo-mae style sushi places have a similar dessert tamago. It really didn't turn out that great, and that's putting it lightly.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, using my new 9-cup KitchenAid food processor that I bought refurbed. I cut the tails off of half a pound of 25 ct white shrimp I bought from whole foods, 7 ounces of yama-imo or mountain yam from Uwaji, and 7 large brown eggs. I cooked everything in my T-Fal non-stick skillet, covered for about 20 minutes and finished in the oven. The oven bit was not part of the recipe but because the middle was not cooking properly, I wanted to solidify the top parts. After attempting to flip it over, part of the middle stuck to the bottom of the skillet. This resulted in a donut shaped piece that fell out, and a circular shape left inside the skillet. I was able to salvage a rectangular piece that looks sort-of like the thing it was supposed to be.

After watching several Youtube videos on making atsuyaki tamago, I think I made the following mistakes

- Heat control is super important and I used too much heat. I would use the lowest heat possible next time.
- I should use the square tamagoyaki pan, ideally the steel version rather than the non-stick version
- I need to mix the brown sugar in more gradually/spread out. It clumped up too much when I made it, and because of the viscosity of the yam/shrimp/egg mixture, it was very had to mix in
- I need to mash the shrimp/yam better. Using the food processor and following the recipe for a "rough paste", it still left visible pieces of shrimp at the bottom. I think I would try leaving it in the food processor for longer or using a knife to mash it more.
- I think I could use another fish in the mixture, perhaps scallops or another white fish.
- Separate the egg white and yolk and mix them separately. In addition, use a whisk to fluff up the egg whites.

All in all, I think the experience was very humbling, and I'm glad that this isn't a dish that's easy to establish mastery over. I plan on continuing to work on this from time to time in hopes of one day being able to replicate the kind I get at Sushi Kashiba. Until then, I'll settle for just buying it once in a while.
