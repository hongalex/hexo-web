Hello! My name is Alex, and I'm a [Developer Programs Engineer](https://medium.com/google-cloud/developer-programs-engineer-say-what-b12829729693) at Google. Check out some of the links in the sidebar!

I have many (indoor) hobbies, including: [optimizing travel/credit card points](https://reddit.com/r/churning), practicing the piano, and playing tabletop/card games with friends. I currently live in the Pacific Northwest and prefer a hot cup of tea and a terminal to going outside in the [rainy months](https://www.tripsavvy.com/does-it-really-rain-in-seattle-4159184 "Not that often!"). I also have a list of preferences that I'll list below to give you a better picture of who I am:

``` bash
tea       > coffee  
mac/linux > windows (except gaming)  
btc       > bch  
magic     > hearthstone  
vscode    > sublime  
cli       > gui  
good food > *
```
